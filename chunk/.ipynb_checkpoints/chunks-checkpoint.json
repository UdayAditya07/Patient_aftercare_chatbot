A surgical wound is a cut made in the skin by your doctor during an operation. At the end of the operation, most cuts are stitched to allow the skin edges to come together and heal. The skin edges usually form a seal within a day or two of the operation"

The primary advantages include: • Reduced postoperative complications: ERAS protocols have consistently been shown to reduce the incidence of complications such as infections, thrombo­ embolic events, and cardiovascular issues"

This is due to the emphasis on early mobilization, proper pain control, and fluid management [57]. • Shortened hospital stay: Studies have demonstrated that ERAS protocols can reduce hospital stay durations by 2 to 3 days on average. By promoting early mobilization, nutrition, and pain management, patients recover more quickly and are discharged sooner [58]"

Patients experience less pain, recover mobility faster, and regain normal gastrointestinal function sooner [59]. • Cost-effectiveness: Shortened hospital stays and fewer complications lead to lower healthcare costs, making ERAS protocols financially beneficial for both healthcare providers and patients [60]. 8"

For instance, a study published in The British Journal of Surgery reported that ERAS reduced postoperative complications by up to 50% and shortened hospital stays by 2–3 days [59, 60]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of over 5000 patients found that ERAS protocols significantly reduced morbidity rates without increasing readmissions [61]"
