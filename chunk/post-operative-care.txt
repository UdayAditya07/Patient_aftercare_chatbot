POSTOPERATIVE PAIN RELIEF Pain is often the patient’s presenting symptom. It can provide useful clinical information and it is your responsibility to use this information to help the patient and alleviate suffering. Manage pain wherever you see patients (emergency, operating room and on the ward) and anticipate their needs for pain management after surgery and discharge. Do not unnecessarily delay the treatment of pain; for example, do not transport a patient without analgesia simply so that the next practitioner can appreciate how much pain the patient is experiencing. Pain Management & Techniques Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Dicloflenac Ibuprofen 25-50 mg PO/PR three times daily (adult) 200-400 mg PO four times daily (adult) Other Paracetamol 500 mg – 1 gm PO four times daily (adult) Pain Management is OUR job!
POSTOPERATIVE PAIN RELIEF Opioids Morphine 2.5-5 mg IV, titrate to effect Wait for 5-10 minutes to observe the effect. Aim for analgesia and retained consciousness. You can always give more medication, but not get back what you have already injected. If opioid analgesia is needed on the ward, it is common to give intramuscularly: Morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IM every four hours (age 3 months – 1 year) 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IM every four hours (1 year – adult) Opiate analgesics should be given cautiously if the age is less than 1 year. They are not recommended for babies aged less than 3 months unless very close monitoring in a neonatal intensive care unit is available. Analgesia in Children Children suffer from pain as much as adults, but may show it in different ways. Make surgical procedures as painless as possible: Oral paracetamol can be given several hours prior to an operation Local anesthetics (bupivacaine 0.25%, not to exceed 1 mL/kg) administered in the operating room can decrease incisional pain Paracetamol (10–15 mg/kg PO/PR every 4–6 hours) is safe and effective For more severe pain, use intravenous narcotics (morphine 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV) every 2–4 hours Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours Ketamine 1-3 mg/kg/hr IV
