Eye make-up may be applied 7 days after the sutures are removed. If you had surgery on your lower lids you may feel a small bump on the outside corner of your eye. This is a dissolvable suture that the body will absorb over the next 8 weeks. Avoid any sun exposure to the incision line or bruised areas until all redness has disappeared. Sunscreen may be applied after the sutures are removed. PLEASE DO NOT CLIP ANY KNOTS! Common Experiences Following Surgery: Blood-tinged tears or secretions: Dab gently with a Kleenex or a warm wash cloth. DO NOT rub the eye and DO NOT use soap near the eye. Bruising: This varies greatly and is often related to how easily you bleed Swelling: Expect swelling. The swelling will be the greatest between the 2 and 4 day after surgery. The swelling can last up to 2-6 weeks. Swelling can be reduced by sleeping with your head above the level of your heart. This can be accomplished by sleeping on extra pillows or in a recliner. Ice packs/crushed ice/frozen peas should be applied every hour for 20-30 minutes for while you are awake. Do not ice more than 30 minutes at a time. Switch to warm compresses after 2-3 days. Warm compresses for 20 minutes at least 4 times per day while the head is elevated above the heart will help swelling as well. Your eyelids may not close completely due to the swelling. To prevent drying of the eye, use artificial tears during the day and apply a small amount of the antibiotic ointment into the lower lid of the eyes before bedtime. Pain and Discomfort: You may experience pain, burning, pulling, a "gritty" feeling, lightness, etc. in and around the eyes. Keeping the eyes lubricated will help reduce these symptoms. You may also experience light sensitivity for several months. Sunglasses are recommended. Activity/Diet: Normal Activity can be resumed tomorrow. Do not strain, perform vigorous activities or swim for the next 2 weeks. You may shower and wash your hair tomorrow. DO NOT sign any legal documents for the next 24 hours. If you had anesthesia, you may feel tired for several days. Get plenty of rest and resume your normal diet, starting with light, non-greasy foods. DO NOT use Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin, Advil etc.), Naproxen (Aleve), or any related drugs for 2 days after surgery unless cleared with your physician. These drugs can lead to bleeding problems. If you are on a blood thinning agent, resume your medication per the instructions of your primary care physician. DO NOT use tobacco in any form for 2 weeks alter surgery as this leads to poor healing. Tobacco can also lead to failure of a skin graft
