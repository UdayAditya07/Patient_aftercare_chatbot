      "\n",
      "i. The RN provides patients discharging to home a 24-hour supply of essential supplies (non-\n",

      "and release the patient.  \n",
      "ii. On time discharge: An expected discharge date and time will be identified by the \n",

      "patient following discharge.  The social worker shall document in the EHR that a discussion \n",
      "about the authorization took place with the patient.  Please note that a lay caregiver involved in \n",
      "the patient’s care prior to discharge may receive patient medical information (including \n",
      "information about discharge planning and post-discharge care) without the patient signing an \n",

      "ii. The case manager determines the patient's ability to pay privately for care. If the patient cannot \n",
