       " '. Post-operative care begins once you arrive in the ward or recovery room, and continues even after you are discharged. Even with day surgeries, you will need to spend some time under medical observation before you can be discharged. The goal is to ensure the best possible outcomes after surgery and the pain is properly managed. Post-operative care in the initial stages is left to the medical team',\n",
       " '. However, at some point this responsibility shifts to the patient, particularly at the point of discharge. This helps give them more control in regaining good health. What Happens After Surgery You will receive one-on-one nursing care as you recover from the anaesthesia. This close observation is important as a person may have an allergic reaction. Other vital signs that will be monitored include body temperature, breathing, pulse, and blood pressure',\n",
       " '. Regular checks on the surgical site will also be carried out to ensure no signs of excessive bleeding or infection. You will be encouraged to start moving as soon as possible. This is to reduce the risk of blood clots developing as a result of lying down too long and blood pooling in your legs. Leg exercises, blood-thinning medications, and support stockings may also be used to promote better blood circulation',\n",
       " '. During the time you will be on the ward, there will be a medical team that will oversee your post-operative care. Once you are deemed stable, you can then be moved to your hospital room, or if an outpatient procedure, begin the discharge process. Before any patient that has undergone outpatient surgery can be discharged, they not only need to have stable vital signs but also be able to drink and urinate',\n",
       " '. It is important to ensure that you have suitable care and equipment to cater to your needs once you are discharged. At the very least, you should have an adult who can assist you in the first 48-72 hours after having been under general anaesthetic or an epidural. You should not drive after having had surgery. Be sure to arrange for transport back home before the surgery. Possible Complications After Surgery Some level of discomfort is to be expected after surgery',\n",
       " '. The more invasive the procedure, the worse you might feel. Some general discomforts include: nausea and vomiting from the anaesthesia dry or sore throat from having apparatus down the windpipe thirst pain, soreness and swelling at the surgical incision site difficulty sleeping gassiness or flatulence Some reactions may however indicate that there has been a complication with the surgery',\n",
       " '. Such serious complications could include: Shock – characterised by a severe drop in blood pressure that prevents blood from circulating. Severe blood loss or haemorrhaging Wound infection - when bacteria enter the surgical incision causing an infection that delays healing and may spread to other tissues and organs via the bloodstream',\n",
       " '. Deep vein thrombosis leading to a pulmonary embolism – whereby a blood clot forms in the leg or other extremity before detaching and travelling to lungs, causing blood flow to be cut. Urinary retention - inability to control or empty your bladder as a reaction to the anaesthesia Allergic reaction to anaesthesia These complications can be life-threatening but are often detected early thanks to nursing care and monitoring of vital signs after surgery',\n",
       " '. They are more likely to happen soon after surgery, so while you are in the recovery room. Once you are stabilised, you will then be transferred to your hospital room for further post-operative care. General Post-Operative Care For inpatient surgeries, once you are out of the recovery room, you will be taken back to your hospital room',\n",
       " '. You will likely be hooked up to equipment for monitoring your oxygen levels and have an intravenous catheter in your arm for the delivery of medications as needed. Depending on the type of surgery you had and your response, you may also be attached to a heart rate monitor, have a feeding tube, and breathing apparatus. Your vital signs will be regularly checked and noted down, with medication being administered as per your doctor’s instructions',\n",
       " '. Some may be orally given, while others may be administered through the IV line or an injection. If possible, you will be encouraged to move around to prevent blood clots from forming, encourage circulation, and maintain muscle strength. Again, depending on what kind of surgery you have had, this may require a physiotherapist to come in to help you with exercises. Your surgeon will also regularly come in to review your condition and determine when you can be discharged',\n",
       " '. Cosmetic Surgery Post-Operative Care With elective surgeries, those that come with advanced notice, patients can better plan for post-operative care. Most cosmetic surgery procedures',\n",
       " 'are elective so your doctor will have advised you of what to expect after the surgery. For instance, for those that have undergone facial procedures, like rhinoplasty, bruising around the face and neck are to be expected. Your doctor will inform you of the normal reactions to expect with the particular procedure you will undergo. This should help you determine what is expected and what may require a return visit to the hospital or emergency room',\n",
       " '. Generally, for cosmetic surgery post-operative care you are expected to: Take it easy. There is likely to be discomfort so you should try to rest as much as possible, giving your body a chance to recover properly. Have a family member or friend who can stay with you for the first 2 or 3 days. They can help ensure you take your medication correctly, prepare your meals, help you keep clean and go to the bathroom, and act if there is an emergency',\n",
       " '. If you have no one available, talk to your doctor who can put you in touch with private home nursing. During the first 24 hours, you may not have much appetite. However, do try to take even a light meal as you are taking your medications. Ensure you stock up on nutritious foods for later on that will help support your recovery. Be sure to also drink plenty of water to replenish fluids lost during surgery and boost circulation. Expect some level of pain and discomfort',\n",
       " '. Expect some level of pain and discomfort. Even with cosmetic surgeries, you will have undergone an invasive procedure. The body parts worked on will certainly feel tender and sore. Take medication as prescribed. During discharge, you will have been given several medications, including antibiotics and painkillers. Take them just as prescribed. Ensure pain medication is taken with food as it can irritate the stomach and cause further nausea',\n",
       " '. Do not avoid pain medication when needed as this can stress your body and prolong your recovery. No exercise. Going back to your regular fitness routine is something that needs to be done slowly and with the approval of your doctor. Avoid any rigorous activities, including tough household chores. Especially in the first week of recovery, you should just walk around the house from time to time to help with circulation and prevent blood clots',\n",
       " '. Exercising too soon can cause your surgical site to swell up further as your blood pressure rises. You may experience a dry or sore throat. This may last a couple of days so drink something warm and soothing or use over the counter lozenges for relief. Use icepacks if allowed. Some procedures allow for use of icing to reduce swelling and discomfort. Apply them as directed by your doctor to prevent injuring your skin. Be aware of likely physical reactions to the surgery',\n",
       " '. As mentioned bruising around the face and neck with facial procedures is normal. Swelling is also common for surgical sites. The majority of this should come down in the following weeks. For some procedures like nose surgeries, the swelling may take up to a year to completely come down. Practice good wound care. There will likely be some discharge with light bleeding for a while. Ensure you keep the incision area clean and moist, using whatever solutions you have been given',\n",
       " '. Watch for white or yellow pus-like discharge, an inflamed incision and a fever. This may indicate an infection and should be urgently addressed with your doctor. Expect some tingling. This is especially common with cosmetic procedures to the face where tiny nerves are likely to have been cut. As they heal, you may experience varied sensations from numbness to sharp pain. This is to be expected, in some cases, for as much as a year after the surgery',\n",
       " '. Perform lymphatic drainage massage to help reduce surgical swelling and scar tissue forming. This stimulation can help improve lymph vessel function and reduce recovery time. When lymph fluid is encouraged to flow, it helps create new pathways and remove toxins and other waste from body parts they are trapped in. can be especially helpful for facial and breast surgeries, and liposuction procedures. Post-Operative Care at Home Once you are discharged, two aspects will require your due attention',\n",
       " '. These include: Pain Management Pain medications will be provided during discharge. Ensure that you take them as directed by your doctor. Many people try to limit their use of such medication for fear they will become addicted. If you have a history of pain medication addiction, do inform your doctor so he can come up with a suitable pain management plan. Proper pain management will impact how quickly you recover from the surgery so follow the instructions given',\n",
       " '. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery when using pain medication. Also, avoid taking any alcohol with pain medication. Wound Care Keeping your wound clean and moist will help in recovery. A pink surgical incision is normal. If it turns red and is bleeding more heavily, accompanied by swelling and pus-like discharge, be sure to get in touch with your doctor. This may indicate an infection',\n",
       " '. This may indicate an infection. Use the dressings provided by your doctor and apply them as directed to provide the right amount of compression. If there is a drain, be sure to empty it as directed about 3-4 times a day and keep track of output. The drain will be removed during a later post-operative appointment. Shockwave Protocols Shockwave therapy involves the delivery of acoustic waves into targeted areas of the body',\n",
       " '. The tissues react by stimulating tissue repair, cell growth, analgesia and restoring mobility. Treatments last between 10-60 minutes, with the intensity being adjusted based on clinical examination and patient response. Pain relief is often felt after the first treatment, with the effect amplified through',\n",
       " 'subsequent sessions. Shockwave therapy is used as an alternative to other interventions like surgery. It is not used as an aid to post-operative recovery on open wounds. It can however be complemented with other treatment measures such as immobilisation and pain medication, as well as reducing scar tissue formation . Experiencing some soreness, mild bruising and swelling after treatment sessions is common. Patients are advised to refrain from physical activity for about 48 hours after sessions',\n",
       " '. There is no prolonged recovery period to be expected after sessions. When to Call Your Doctor or Emergency Services Once you have been discharged, you will not have fully recovered. Complications can still arise, so monitor your condition to ascertain if you are going through a medical emergency',\n",
       " '.

       " 'What happens after an appendectomy? In the hospital After surgery, you will be taken to the recovery room. Your healthcare team will watch your vital signs, such as your heart rate and breathing. Your recovery will depend on the type of surgery that was done and the type of anesthesia you had. Once your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing are stable and you are awake and alert, you will be taken to your hospital room. A laparoscopic appendectomy may be done on an outpatient basis',\n",
       " '. In this case, you may be discharged and sent home from the recovery room. You will have pain medicine as needed. This may be by prescription or from a nurse. Or you may give it to yourself through a device connected to your IV line. You may have a thin plastic tube that goes through your nose into your stomach. This is used to remove stomach fluids and air that you swallow. The tube will be taken out when your bowels are working normally',\n",

Stitches, clips and staples are usually removed between three and 21 days after treatment, depending on the type of operation you have',\n",

       " 'Surgical Techniques and Procedures 2 2.1 Immediate postoperative phase The immediate postoperative phase refers to the first few hours after surgery, usually spent in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). During this phase, the patient’s condition is closely monitored, and interventions focus on stabilizing vital signs, managing pain, and preventing early complications. • Monitoring vital signs: Close monitoring of vital signs is crucial in this phase',\n",
       " '. A sud\\xad den drop in blood pressure, rapid heart rate, or low oxygen saturation can indicate complications such as hemorrhage, hypovolemia, or respiratory distress [2]. • Airway management and Respiratory Support: In the immediate phase, the patient may still be under the effects of anesthesia, making airway manage\\xad ment essential. Some patients may require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, especially after major surgeries or procedures involving the chest or abdomen [3]',\n",
       " '. • Pain control: Managing pain is critical to preventing postoperative complications such as cardiovascular stress or impaired breathing. A multimodal approach, including opioid and non-opioid analgesics, is often used to manage pain effectively [4]. 2.2 Intermediate postoperative phase This phase typically begins once the patient is stable and able to move out of the PACU, continuing through the first few days post-surgery',\n",
       " '. The focus shifts toward early mobilization, infection prevention, and supporting the body’s healing processes. • Wound management: Regular dressing changes and inspections for signs of infection or dehiscence (wound reopening) are crucial. Wounds healing by primary or secondary intention should be monitored closely, and healthcare providers must ensure sterile techniques to prevent infections [5]',\n",
       " '. • Early mobilization: Immobility increases the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, and muscle wasting. Early mobi\\xad lization helps reduce these risks by improving circulation and promoting respira\\xad tory function [6]. Depending on the surgery type, patients may begin walking or engaging in light activities as soon as they are stable',\n",
       " '. • Fluid and electrolyte balance: Proper fluid management is vital for avoiding dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and renal complications, particularly in patients who have experienced significant blood loss. IV fluids, diuretics, or electrolytes may be adjusted according to the patient’s needs [7]. • Nutritional support: The intermediate phase may involve gradual reintroduction of oral feeding or continued nutritional support through IV or enteral routes',\n",

The goal of this phase is long-term rehabilitation, preventing complications, and ensuring that the patient returns to their normal level of function',\n",
       " '. • Follow-up care: Scheduled follow-up visits allow healthcare providers to monitor recovery progress, adjust medications, and address any complications that arise. Depending on the surgery, imaging studies or lab tests may be required to ensure proper healing [9]. • Rehabilitation and physical therapy: Physical therapy is often needed to restore function, strength, and range of motion, especially after orthopedic or neurological surgeries',\n",
       " '. Tailored rehabilitation programs help prevent long-term disability [10]. • Mental health support: The psychological effects of surgery, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress, can delay recovery. Mental health profes\\xad sionals may be involved in the extended postoperative phase to provide counsel\\xad ing and emotional support [11]. 3',\n",

They work by reducing inflammation, which is often a source of postoperative pain',\n",
       " '. However, NSAIDs carry a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and should be used cautiously, particu\\xad larly in patients with renal impairment [14]. • Local anesthetics: Local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine and lidocaine, can be used for regional nerve blocks or local infiltration to provide targeted pain relief without systemic side effects. Continuous nerve block catheters are increasingly used in major surgeries to provide prolonged pain relief (Table 2) [15]. 3.1',\n",

This includes setting realistic expectations and encourag\\xad ing patient involvement in their own care [44]. • Nutritional optimization: Ensuring patients are nutritionally prepared for surgery. Malnutrition can lead to delayed healing and increased risk of complica\\xad tions. Carbohydrate loading (instead of fasting) just before surgery has been shown to improve outcomes [45]',\n",
       " '. • Minimizing fasting: ERAS protocols advocate for shortened fasting periods (often only 6 h for solids and 2 h for liquids) before surgery, which helps main\\xad tain energy stores and reduces insulin resistance [46]. • Smoking and alcohol cessation: Patients are encouraged to stop smoking and limit alcohol intake before surgery, as both can impair wound healing and increase complication risks (Table 6) [47]',\n",

       " '. By reducing opioid dependency, patients are less likely to experience opioid-related side effects like constipation, nausea, and respiratory depression [49]. • Fluid management: Optimal fluid balance is critical in ERAS protocols. Avoiding both dehydration and overhydration is key, as excess fluid can increase the risk of postoperative complications such as edema and impaired wound healing [50]',\n",
       " '. • Temperature regulation: Maintaining normal body temperature during sur\\xad gery can prevent complications such as wound infections and cardiovascular stress [51]. Postoperative care: • Early mobilization: ERAS emphasizes early movement (within hours after surgery) to prevent complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and muscle atrophy. Early ambulation improves circulation, lung function, and gastrointestinal motility [52]',\n",
       " '. • Early enteral nutrition: Initiating oral intake as early as possible (within 24 hours postoperatively) helps to restore gut function, reduce the risk of infections, and promote healing. Studies have shown that early enteral feeding shortens hospital stays and lowers the incidence of complications such as wound infections and pneumonia [53]',\n",
       " '. • Pain control: As previously discussed, a multimodal approach to pain man\\xad agement is used to provide effective analgesia with minimal reliance on opioids. This enhances recovery by minimizing opioid-related side effects and allowing patients to be more active and cooperative with their rehabilitation programs [54]. • Prevention of postoperative complications: Proactive measures are employed to prevent common complications such as DVT, PE, atelectasis, and infections',\n",
       " '. For example, mechanical prophylaxis with compression stockings or pharmaco\\xad logical prophylaxis (e.g., anticoagulants) are used to prevent thromboembolic events [55]. • Psychological support: Anxiety and stress can negatively impact recovery. ERAS encourages psychological support, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness techniques, and open communication between patients and healthcare providers [56].',\n",

The primary advantages include: • Reduced postoperative complications: ERAS protocols have consistently been shown to reduce the incidence of complications such as infections, thrombo\\xad embolic events, and cardiovascular issues',\n",
       " '. This is due to the emphasis on early mobilization, proper pain control, and fluid management [57]. • Shortened hospital stay: Studies have demonstrated that ERAS protocols can reduce hospital stay durations by 2 to 3 days on average. By promoting early mobilization, nutrition, and pain management, patients recover more quickly and are discharged sooner [58]',\n",
       " '. • Improved patient outcomes: By reducing the physical and psychological stress associated with surgery, ERAS improves overall patient outcomes. Patients experience less pain, recover mobility faster, and regain normal gastrointestinal function sooner [59]. • Cost-effectiveness: Shortened hospital stays and fewer complications lead to lower healthcare costs, making ERAS protocols financially beneficial for both healthcare providers and patients [60]. 8',\n",

A mild TBI or concussion is caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or body that causes: The head and brain to move quickly back and forth. The brain to bounce or twist in the skull from this sudden movement. Chemical changes in the brain and sometimes stretching and damage to the brain cells. Doctors may describe these injuries as “mild” brain injuries because they are usually not life-threatening',\n",

Some mild TBI and concussion symptoms (listed at right) may appear right away, while other symptoms may not appear for hours or days after the injury. Symptoms generally improve over time, and most people will feel better within a couple of weeks. If you have symptoms that concern you or are getting worse, be sure to talk with your doctor',\n",

Most people will have one or more symptoms that affect how they feel, think, act, or sleep. Symptoms may change during recovery. For example, you may have headaches and feel sick to your stomach right after the injury. A week or two after your injury you may notice other symptoms, like feeling more emotional than usual or having trouble sleeping',\n",
